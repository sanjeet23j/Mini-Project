                    <h1>Proxy</h1>
                    <p>Here’s a scenario: you want to access a specific website, but your country has blocked it for some reason. It might not even be a dangerous website, and you simply would like to connect with friends using Facebook, WhatsApp or Telegram. Or maybe you’re in school, but the school has blocked access to YouTube on their Wi-Fi network. How can you get around these restrictions?</p>
                    <p>Enter the proxy. Proxies can come in a couple of different forms, most notably as a server or website. They are basically the keys that you need to unlock the rest of the Internet regardless of your Internet connection or location. There are millions of proxy websites available online, but the vast majority aren’t worth the time it takes to enter their web address. Today, we’re here to take away all of the confusion surrounding proxies. We’ll discuss the basics you need to know, compare them to similar services, and even provide you with a list of the ten best proxy websites you can find online.</p>
                    <h3>What is a Proxy?</h3>

                    <p>A proxy site essentially allows you to send or receive information to and from a variety of different websites and servers. The best part is you don’t need to actually visit these websites or servers with your personal IP address. This task is accomplished by basically tricking your network’s firewall or the network filters that you are visiting an allowed website even if your country has blocked it.</p>
                    <div style="float: right">
                        <img class="img img-responsive" src="images/what-proxy.jpg" alt="who we are">
                    </div>
                    <p>Proxies are just one of the many options that people use to access blocked websites and hide their IP addresses. There are also VPNs and a few other options, although free proxy websites are typically easier for beginning users to use. They are typically fairly risk-free as long as you use a reputable proxy website like the ones on the following list. You usually don’t need to download any specialized software and can start privately and freely browsing the Internet directly from the proxy’s website. Proxies will also improve your Internet connection in many cases as well by bypassing all of the firewalls and filters that can throttle your speed from your ISP.</p>
                    <p>These facts are just the basics of proxy websites, and there are a lot of technical details behind the functions of proxies.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to the free proxy websites available, not all are created equal. Many of the proxy sites are free, while others offer premium paid features. They can greatly improve your Internet browsing experience, although you should be wary of some. If you choose the wrong proxy website, you could actually put your security and anonymity at risk. For this reason, we’ve done our due diligence to research and test every proxy website features on this list.</p>
                    <h2>Reasons You Might Need a Proxy</h2>

                    <p>Now that we’ve covered the basics of proxies, you might want to know why people choose to use proxies. Beyond protecting anonymity, proxies also provide a host of other benefits.</p>
                    <div style="float: right; border: 1px solid rgba(168, 168, 168, 0.69); border-radius: 4px ">
                        <img class="img img-responsive" src="images/keyboard1.jpg" alt="who we are">
                    </div>
                    <h2>1. Control Internet Usage in Corporate Environments</h2>
                    <p>Many people choose to use proxies on corporate networks to control which websites their employees can use. They might not want their employees to browse social media or other websites during working hours, and a proxy on the network can prevent this.</p>
                    <p>It might seem a little over the top, but this can help many employers ensure that their workers are productive during their billable hours. By forcing their employees to go through the proxy, they can also track and monitor things like websites visited, amount of time spent on the websites, and more for each employee.</p>
                    <h3>2. Save Bandwidth and Improve Speed</h3>
                    <p>Companies can choose to use proxy servers to help save money on bandwidth and improve the overall speed of their network. These proxy servers can compress the traffic that goes through them, and even cache files and strip advertisements before they reach a device. If a company has thousands of employees, proxies can save them thousands of dollars in savings each year.</p>
                    <p>One example of this is web page caching. For instance, if one employee visits a webpage for the first time, the proxy can cache it and store it locally. Then, whenever another employee visits the same page, assuming it hasn’t changed, they’ll simply see the cached version without having to reconnect to the website. This improves loading speeds and helps save the company on bandwidth.</p>
                    <h3>3. Privacy Benefits</h3>
                    <p>Whenever you browse the Internet normally, the websites that you visit can see the IP address that you use. This can pose security and anonymity risks since every IP address is unique and easily traced. Hackers can use your IP address to pinpoint your geographic location, and the browser also sends user agent information to the website. What’s more, cookies stored on your computer can provide even more personal information for websites and hackers.</p>
                    <p>With a proxy server, you can choose to hide your IP address or use a completely different one. You can also disable cookies, user data, and much more. Proxies provide users with a decent amount of privacy, so if you want to browse the web without having to stress about websites and advertisements tracking your history, a proxy is a must-have.</p>
                    <h3>4. Improve Security</h3>
                    <p>If you want to improve the security of your network, proxy services could help you in a couple of ways. You can use a proxy to block certain malicious websites and even use them for encryption services to make sure that your data is kept secure.</p>
                    <h3>5. Access to Blocked Resources on the Internet</h3>
                    <p>Many people in countries outside the United States use proxies to bypass government censorship. Many governments around the world block certain sites in efforts to shut down dissent. With proxies, you can trick websites like Facebook and other social media to circumvent governmental blocks.</p>
                    <p>Even if you don’t need to use social media for dissent, there are also cases where a proxy could come in handy. For example, popular streaming site, Hulu, is only available in the United States and Japan. If you want to watch the latest shows but live outside these countries, all you have to do is find a great free proxy website, and you are good to go!</p>
                    <h2>How do Proxies Work?</h2>
                    <div style="float: right; border: 1px solid rgba(168, 168, 168, 0.69); border-radius: 4px ">
                        <img class="img img-responsive" src="images/how-proxy-works.png" alt="who we are">
                    </div>
                    <p>A proxy is essentially a point-to-point link from your device to a remote location of the Internet. For example, if you were sitting in a coffee shop in Chicago and wanted to access a website that is only available for people in China, with a free proxy website, you could visit those websites. In reality, this feature is actually more useful for people in countries that block popular websites such as Netflix, Facebook, WhatsApp, and more.</p>
                    <p>Proxies are the go-between your device and the website, and through the use of servers placed in different locations around the world, you can essentially trick the website into thinking your IP address is in a different country. Proxies are 100% legal if you use them legally (I.e., don’t use them for illegal activities) and the best part is that many of the best proxies available online are completely free to us without the need for a subscription.</p>
                    <h3>The Difference Between a Proxy Server and a Proxy Website</h3>
                    <div style="float: right; border: 1px solid rgba(168, 168, 168, 0.69); border-radius: 4px ">
                        <img class="img img-responsive" src="images/proxy-img.png" alt="who we are">
                    </div>
                    <p>Many people think that proxy websites are the same thing as proxy servers and use the two terms interchangeably. Although they are similar, there are a few differences to keep in mind.</p>
                    <p>Proxy websites let you browse the web using their Internet connection wherever it is in the world. This is a more basic approach but essentially accomplishes the same goal as a proxy server. You can access a proxy website the same that you would access any other website by simply entering the URL into your Internet browser’s address bar.</p>
                    <p>Proxy servers, on the other hand, are similar to proxy websites with a few fundamental differences in operation. Proxy servers provide users with a unique IP address that you then set up in your web browser to then surf the net. You are still browsing through the proxy service’s Internet connection, but this version usually allows for a stronger connection.</p>
                    <h3>
                        The Difference Between Proxies and VPNs</h3>
                    <div style="float: right; border: 1px solid rgba(168, 168, 168, 0.69); border-radius: 4px ">
                        <img class="img img-responsive" src="images/proxy-vs-vpn-compared.png" alt="who we are">
                    </div>
                    <p>Many people think that proxies and VPNs are the same things. It is true that they both function to provide the same benefits to users. These benefits include anonymous browsing online, increased security, and revamped privacy protection from outside eyes such as the government or an ISP.</p>
                    <p>Proxies function as the go-between for the Internet connection and your device. Each proxy will have its own IP address and prevents data transfers from being traced directly back to your device.</p>
                    <p>VPNs, on the other hand, are more like tunnels, that block out any interference or tracking from external sources. When you use a VPN, you are pretty much connecting directly to the Internet privately. They are regarded as the most secure way to browse the web anonymously. You can get past geo-blocked filters and firewalls with VPNs, and typically, you need to pay a subscription fee to use a VPN on your Internet connection.</p>
